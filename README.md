# About the PROJECT FLASH-READ

A self-made project built from scratch which helps you to read passages within a flash by flashing the words infront of eyes one by one , thus helping you read faster than the usual speed of an average human  

## Description

An average human can read 250 Words Per Minute . However , our mind can do much faster but due to limitiation of the fact that our mind tends to read spaces between them as well so costing us 250 words per minute, but by eliminating the spaces between them your mind only just by focusing on words, you can speed read up to 500 words per minute

So with some research and references , we can actually read text without spaces in between and understand it as well .

If by flashing the words infront of eyes one by one will help to read every word without focusing on word separated spaces and understand it as well . 

## Note to use 

Everytime you want a new passage to flashread , you might have to refresh the page ( it might also work without refreshing but still there might be some issues which might be improved in later versions )  


# Getting Started 

## Usage Preview

![Preview](https://github.com/simplekind/Flash-Read/blob/master/img/FlashRead.gif?raw=true)

## Features 

- Pause/Play
- Speed Up WPM ( Maximum possible : 6000 WPM )
- Speed Down WPM ( Minumum possible : 40 WPM )
- Slider to slide to a particular word anytime you want to see alongwith showing word number

## Prototyping with 
- Figma (Software) 

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript 
- GSAP min JS ( a JavaScript Animation Library )

## So how does it works  ? 

Since I need to show words at a particalr WPM , I calculated how much time it takes for a word to display : 
For 400 Words Per Minute :

400 Words â†’ 1 minute  â†’ 60 seconds 
1 Word â†’ 60/400 seconds â†’   60/400  * 1000 milliseconds

So to display words a particular rate(let sat x wpm) , I used the formula 60/x * 1000
